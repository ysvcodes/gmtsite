---

## **üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation**

### **Phase 1: Database Setup (Supabase)**

#### **Bookings Table Structure**
```sql
CREATE TABLE bookings (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  phone TEXT NOT NULL,
  company TEXT,
  booking_time TIMESTAMP,
  call_status TEXT DEFAULT 'scheduled', -- scheduled, completed, no-show, rescheduled
  interest_level TEXT, -- high, medium, low, not-interested
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### **Follow-up Sequences Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE follow_up_sequences (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  booking_id UUID REFERENCES bookings(id),
  sequence_type TEXT, -- 'no-show', 'completed', 'interested', 'not-ready'
  step_number INTEGER,
  message_type TEXT, -- 'sms', 'email'
  message_content TEXT,
  sent_at TIMESTAMP,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending' -- pending, sent, delivered, failed
);
```

#### **Client Segments Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE client_segments (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  booking_id UUID REFERENCES bookings(id),
  company_size TEXT, -- small, medium, large
  industry TEXT,
  automation_needs TEXT, -- lead-gen, operations, customer-service
  budget_range TEXT, -- low, medium, high
  urgency_level TEXT, -- immediate, planning, exploring
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### **Phase 2: SMS Integration**

#### **Immediate Booking Confirmation**
```javascript
// After successful Cal.com booking
const bookingData = {
  name: document.getElementById('modalName').value,
  phone: document.getElementById('modalPhone').value,
  email: document.getElementById('modalEmail').value,
  company: document.getElementById('modalCompany').value,
  bookingTime: new Date().toISOString()
};

// Send to Supabase
await supabase.from('bookings').insert(bookingData);

// Trigger SMS via webhook
await fetch('/api/send-sms', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    to: bookingData.phone,
    message: `Hi ${bookingData.name}! üëã I just saw you booked our AI automation call. Looking forward to discussing how we can transform ${bookingData.company} with custom automation solutions. See you soon! - Atirola`
  })
});
```

#### **SMS API Setup (Twilio)**
```javascript
// Twilio configuration
const twilio = require('twilio');
const client = twilio(process.env.TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, process.env.TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN);

async function sendSMS(to, message) {
  try {
    const result = await client.messages.create({
      body: message,
      from: process.env.TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER,
      to: to
    });
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('SMS sending failed:', error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```
